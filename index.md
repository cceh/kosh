Kosh has been conceived to provide API access to **any XML-encoded** lexical dataset, independently of the data model employed.

Its name Kosh derives from the Hindi word for dictionary or lexicon, कोश _koś_ or _kosh_, which in turn derives from Sanskrit कोश _kośa_ with the same meaning.

## Features

* Kosh processes lexical data in XML format.
* Two APIs, GraphQL and REST, access the data stored in elasticsearch.
* Kosh can be deployed either via Docker or natively on Unix-like systems.

## How to run Kosh

You can configurate Kosh to create APIs for any XML-encoded lexical resource. Learn how to do it for your own resources in [deployment](/docs/deployment.md)
